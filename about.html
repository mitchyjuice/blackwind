    <p>Rain fell onto the mud as wooden-wagons being pulled by horses, splashed past the puddles of murky water. The smell of petrichor filled the air around as the usual summer breeze at this time of year, descended into an all-out gust of gale-force winds as the grey skies densely covered the typical blue that would smile down upon the lands below. A grey day indeed. The sounds of pattering rain on wooded shelters and ale-houses along the road was heard by all who walked upon this road. The splashing of puddles and pattering of horses hooves and carriages wheels squelching through the mud on the road. Trees bellowing in the wind, along with the tall grass along-side the road facing the shelters and ale-houses as the forests of Altonshire could be seen for miles. This is the first road in the small town of Heart Wood, A small village and settlement in Neymoor in the county of Altonshire. The best village in the whole of Altonshire the residents will have you know. Consisting of the ‘Moor Folk’ as they’re called around Esdon. Neymoor is known for its mix of individuals. Local kooks, old drunks, Men who stand on boxes in the pouring rain preaching of the power of Tarmen, Farmers, even the odd thief. Families and scholars who live and breathe their work in the Library of the Abaadistar, which lurks on the outskirts of the North of Heart Wood, with the Clock Tower of the Abaadistar being seen in the distance over the forest as it’s long, white-spire, out-reaches the tops of the tallest trees, touching the overcast heavens as the rest of the ever-expanding Abaadistar stays hidden below the green veil of the trees.</p>
    
    <p>As the carriages passed by the ale-houses and the rain attacked the shelter of the platforms and porches. A leak splattered water over the naked wood of an old, decrepit ale-house like a waterfall. Though the leak seemed to shorten and slow as a hammer could be heard nailing on wood. On top of the shelter, sat a young man. His long, brown hair wrapped behind his head, heavy with water, hit off his back with each blow of the hammer. A bald face and bright, blue eyes looked at the nails penetrating the wood. A skinny frame was revealed with a face plastered in bone as his cheekbones were more than visible. His black, long, leather coat covered the cloth under it from being drenched by the onslaught of the summer storm over Heart Wood. The same could not be said about his black pants, drenched from the rain. Leaking into his leather boots above his ankles. His clothing was tatty. Ripped, unclean. An honest living you could tell, was much part of his everyday life. As each wallop of the hammer glued the nails into the wood covering the hole in the roof of the ale-house, the pattering on the floor below the shelter slowed until it completely stopped.</p>

    <p>“That should do it Mr. Westing!” the Young Man shouted as he slowly wiped the water trickling from his head with the dirty sleeve of his leather coat. An aging man appeared in the open window behind the young man. A fat frame and a slightly black but mostly grey moustache, shown along with a graceful smile. Dressed in a white shirt he could barely tuck into his black pants as his stomach lingered over his waistline. “Kai, Gratitude to Tarmen for your help. You do a world of good for this village. We’re lucky to have you” he said whilst a happy smile covered his chubby face. “It’s no bother at all Mr. Westing. I’m always happy to help” Kai exclaimed, smiling back and slowly raising up from his knees. “The Billbrid brothers will no doubt still have something to complain about when they come in for their nightly drink and punch-up but at least it’s not about my stinking leak on the porch” Mr. Westing laughed. “Well they always will have something to complain about those two” Kai replied with a generous smile across his Young face.</p>

    <p>Mr. Westing began to stand back as Kai hunched under the window as he climbed inside the Ale House as he began to smell the scent of wet and aging wood inside again as the echoes of his big leather boots could be heard bellowing through the tavern as he descended down a corridor and then down the stairs. Mr. Westing followed. “I’ve left a couple of Yearn on the side for you Kai, y’know, to help with your Mother and the rest. How is she?” Mr. Westing asked. “You’re too kind Mr. Westing” Kai said as he walked passed the wooden sides of the bar and pocketed the money. “She’s doing fine. She’s having trouble keeping an eye on Val though” he replied. “Ah, how old is she now?” Mr. Westing asked. “Sixteen today! It’s maddening how much time passes isn’t it?” Kai replied abruptly. “Good Tarmen! She’ll be living in the Capital with a fellow made of money soon” Mr. Westing joked. “Well, she needs to learn how to stop hanging around with that Tommy Landstead first, he’s bad news that Lad” Kai exclaimed. Mr. Westing began to bellow with laughter “She’s out of that boy’s league. When do you reach ‘the age’ then?” he asked. “Next week” Kai answered quickly, almost before Mr. Westing finished his sentence. “Well then, not long before you head off for training. Eighteen, I remember it as though it was last week” Mr. Westing exclaimed as he looked up to his Ale House roof as he began to reminisce. “I know. James has got me doing drills now in the barn outside” Kai replied looking disappointed. “Strange fellow that James. Eerily quiet. I never see him. Does he leave that house ever?” Mr. Westing said as he began to stroke his moustache in curiosity. Kai laughed. “He rarely leaves the barn or the house but he’s always been quiet” Kai replied as they both smiled.</p>

    <p>“Well Mr. Westing, it’s been a pleasure fixing that leak but I’ve got errands to run and a present for my sister to get. I’ll be seeing you before I head off for training” Kai said as he smiled at Mr. Westing, slowly walking through the front doors as he approached the muddy road facing the forest on the other side of the road. “Get her something nice and wish her a good day from me and May Tarmen be with you for your Exam tomorrow!” Mr. Westing shouted whilst waving as Kai walked away, up the road and towards the rest of the town. “I will and Thank you Mr. Westing!” Kai shouted back as he waved and turned away and walked along the road. His boots slid in the mud and splashed puddles as carriages passed him by. Kai walked by other residents on the roads and walkways of the village by waving or saying a polite hello as the jingling of Yearn Coins in his pocket sung together with each step he took.</p>

    <p>Kai approached a busy road that was covered by a hardened mud as many carriages passed by and the bustle of folk walking by and chattering amongst themselves echoed down the busy street. Kai could smell the sweet scent of Lendle as his stomach started to growl as if to raise its stern voice at him, demanding he eats now. Kai began to walk over to the cart that sold the Lendle slowly. Lendle is a type of sweet meat from the Lendle Bird that is local to Altonshire and that is glazed in the honey of the Neymoor region. It is placed between a hot toasted bun and is a well-known delicacy to the Neymoorians. It can be sprinkled with a spicy, apple sauce for an extra kick. “I’ll have one please, Mr. Jem” Kai politely asked the man on the Lendle stall. “Ah, Kai! I wondered when you would get here. The usual with Apple Sauce?” Mr. Jem asked. His hairless head shadowed by the umbrella that covered his cart with a stripy red and white apron over his shirt and pants. He reached his wooden tongs into the cast-iron door he slid over as the smell became even more glorious to Kai’s nose. “I’ll never tire of that smell” Kai mumbled. Mr. Jem began to laugh “I think you’re my best customer” he said as he chuckled away to himself.</p>

    <p>A carriage passed by as Kai began to stare as it passed by, he instantly became aware of the men in the back of the big carriage and became agitated. The carriages became an entourage full of soldiers in full uniform, perched in the carriages, holding weapons, steel helmets with steel-plated armour with the sign of a Sun and an Arrow placing through it. Spears, shields, swords, axes, bows and arrows accompanied them as they scowled at the whole town, as they rode past them until they made a swift right turn out of sight. The rumbling of the huge company could still be heard on the busy main road as they rode further and further until it quietened again. The last carriage to turn was covered in a large black sheet as it took more than ten horses to carry it which puzzled Kai. It reached out of the carriage but was held on by rope. It struggled to reach round the corner but eventually pulled and disappeared into the distance along with the Soldiers.</p>

    <p>“It seems there’s more and more of them every day” Kai whispered. “I’m with you on that one laddie” Mr. Jem whispered back looking slightly worried. “Supposedly, the King is worried of another uprising from these parts. Heard that he’s got his eyes everywhere” Mr. Jem said to a still puzzled Kai. Kai’s eyes still seemed firmly fixed on the corner that the Soldiers and carriages disappeared around. “It was fifteen years ago. Why would anyone want to start that war again?” Kai asked still firmly fixed on the corner. “People still seem unhappy with the taxes and the laws he added it seems” Mr. Jem sighed as he put the last of the Lendle meat on the toasted bun. Kais eyes still were transfixed on the corner, as the sight of so many soldiers began to bother him more and more with each passing thought. “I hope they don’t cause trouble like last time” he said softly as his eyes moved back to the sight of Mr. Jem and his Lendle Cart. “There will more than likely be a couple of punch ups. They love a good one those soldiers” Mr. Jem added. “That’s true” Kai quickly replied as he began to smile again. Mr. Jem softly spread his apple sauce over the Lendle meat and placed the toasted bun over the top as he wrapped it in a short paper bag showing the end of the Lendle Bun and handed it over to Kai. “Half a Yearn me laddie” Mr. Jem said placing his large hands out. Kai put his hand in his right pocket as it jingled and brandished five gold coins with a sun on one side and a crescent moon on the other and three small silver coins with the same sun and moon on each side. He placed a small silver coin in Mr. Jems palm. “Thanks me laddie” Mr. Jem said. “Thank you, Mr. Jem” Kai said walking away as he tucked into his Lendle, the taste almost making his eyes roll to the back of his head. “Delicious as ever. See you tomorrow Mister!” Kai said walking away as Mr. Jem waved him off.</p>

    <p>Kai began to walk a couple of steps further and past the folk in the town centre on the main road as it was still just as busy. Passing shops, more ale-houses, stables and hotels as the rain continued to lash down on the road and wooden structures of the town. Kai approached a door of a shop and wolfed the remainder of his Lendle Bun down his throat and grasped the handle of the door and released a large belch through the streets of Heart Wood. With his other arm he wiped his mouth with his sleeve and then began to move the door open as a bell rang above the door to alert the owners inside of a customer. Kai opened the door and stepped inside and closed the door behind him, leaving the loud noises of the busy town behind him and entering a chasm of silence and the sounds of the bell ringing slightly once more as the door shut into place.</p>

    <p>The shop was set out in different parts. The nearest to Kai, sat a case full of random artefacts, toys and other miscellaneous things with a wooden sign above it reading ‘Altonshire’. Kai scanned the room slowly as the case next to the one reading ‘Altonshire’ read ‘Elithor’. Kai began to slowly walk around the shop floor, dodging shelves and reading the wooden signs over them. ‘Ralem’ was next then ‘Ithea’ and then ‘Dirimir’ which in its small one sectioned shelf held very few things inside some glass casing, as well as a small, black knife. He began to circle the room approaching the other side. This sign read ‘Dulwic’ containing what could have been a small armoury for miniature weapons and the next one read ‘Stromfeld’. Kai looked closely at the signs and things that lay on the shelves. Kai approached the sign that said ‘Almanor’ and the things within the shelving. “Ah, here you are” Kai whispered to himself as he stopped to take a closer and more careful look at the items on the shelving.</p>

    <p>He scanned the items with his eyes as he looked at each shelf on the wall and in the cupboards before his eyes, stopped and opened that bit wider as a smile lay on his face. Kai reached onto the shelf and grasped a thin, silver chain that when he pulled revealed a locket. A silver locket, engraved with a crescent moon that greeted you with a happy face upon it the Moon. He opened the locket and a painted picture of a mountain with a large windmill appeared upon it. Kai smiled at the beautiful picture inside of it as he began to walk towards the counter to pay for the locket. Behind the counter was a tall, rather slim man. Black hair smothered his head and a long, black moustache that covered his top lip and cheeks. The man behind the counter smiled as he looked down at Kai’s hands to see the locket in his grasp. “She’s a beaut isn’t she?” the man behind the counter said. “She certainly is” Kai excitedly gasped as he dropped the locket on the counter. “How much?” Kai asked. “She’s one of me finest. 3 Yearns” The shopkeeper exclaimed. “Those Almanorians know how to make fine Silver” the Shopkeeper added. “I’ll take it” Kai shouted as he placed his hand out on the table in front of him and dropped three gold coins on the table. “Thanks me laddie” The shopkeeper shouted in his brisk low tone. “Thank you” Kai replied with his barely broken voice as he turned away with a smile.</p>

    <p>Kai approached the door with haste but something stopped his hand from grabbing the door handle at the exit of the shop. He couldn’t explain what it was that made him turn around and look into the corner of the store but he knew he could feel something calling to him. Kai turned away from the door and walked over to a part of the shop that looked like it hadn’t been touched in years. No lights shone on this part of the shop, dust and cobwebs surrounded it. Any passer-by or customer would have easily thought this part of the shop was off limits but it was surely open to the public. The shopkeeper who still stood at his counter watching Kai, seen him approach the dark corner and his face changed from a pleasant smile, to a face of curiosity. His eyes fixed on Kai to see what the boy would do next. </p>

    <p>Kai approached the corner and felt around for a while with his hands in the shelving and cupboards like a blind man feeling around for an object. Kai shut the doors of the cupboard and scanned the shelves further. His eyes glazed over with a look of confusion as he looked more deeply. His hand reached out and he grabbed something. Kai pulled the small object off the shelf and moved it into the light that barely shown through this part of the shop as he began to open his hand out. It was a broken piece of metal. Sharp around the edges but surprisingly, not a single speck of dust covered it, as well as the area around it. The rest of the cupboards were littered with dust which Kai found odd. Kai began to look at the piece of metal and could still not tell where it had come from and what it was broken from. It shone spectacularly and was as smooth as bare skin unless you felt the sharp edges. He turned the metal over and small engravings were in the centre of the metal shard. It was a language that was not the common tongue and one he had never seen before. Kai looked closer at the language as he started to speak “Eternal, Forever, We stand…” he whispered to himself. Kai began to question why he spoke the words that just came out of his mouth and how he knew there was more to the message. His eyes widened. </p>

    <p>“How can I read this? What is this language?” he thought. “How much for the metal piece?” Kai shouted, still gazing at the metal shard. “Ah, just take it me laddie, its worthless” the Shopkeeper said, still looking on in puzzlement at Kai in the dark of the room. “I’ve been wanting to get rid of them things over there for a while” the Shopkeeper added. “Thank You” Kai exclaimed as he took the metal shard and placed it in his pocket in his dirty and still soaking wet jacket and headed for the door and left the shop, entering the loud outside once more, leaving the near silence of the shop behind. The shopkeeper still gazed at the door as if Kai was still present in the shop. A frown now plastered his face. He then walked over to the door and placed a sign from next to the door in the window that read ‘CLOSED’ and locked the door with a key he picked out of his pocket.</p>

    <p>Kai stood under the wooden shelter ready to cross the street as he watched the rain explode over the town and attack the wood like small pellets. He reached into his pocket and brought out the metal shard again as he began to inspect it closer. Kai looked and still wondered “Why can I read this?” he thought. Kai began to look hesitant as he looked around and received strange looks from the locals that passed him by. He quickly put the Shard back in his pocket and looked back towards the road. He looked in each direction and decided to walk straight over and go down the road that opened in front of him. He grabbed the hood that lay under his leather coat, stretched it from under the coat and covered it over his head, as he paced over the busy street, dodging horses, carriages and people alike. Kai walked down the long road passing small houses as the shops began to fade into the distance and now woodland of the Doosan Forest surrounding Heart Wood became clearer as houses and huts surrounded the road and Kai. Kai came to a junction. “Left or a right?” he thought to himself. He paused for a moment and took a step to the left and walked on up the left side of the road. The rain would have spells of hitting the ground ferociously and almost to the point of stopping on his journey as Kai still would pull out the Metal Shard in puzzlement and place it back when he walked past another townsfolk. “Typical Neymoorian rain” he huffed to himself. </p>

    <p>Kai approached an opening of the road as the woodland seem to spread out further. Kai walked on as a lake appeared in the distance as he walked up the slope of the open, muddy road. Trees surrounded the lake as well as a couple of houses, huts and piers which could just be seen over the vast lake, scattered around the shoreline. The humongous trees touched the reaches of the clouds as they started to clear in the sky as the Sun shown signs of setting as the twilight colours of pinks and oranges started to pollute the blue and grey and the smell of the wet forest filled Kai’s nostrils. Kai began to smile and walk on. On the approach to the lake was a small pier with a rickety old wooden path to small, old, rusted boats. Next to the pier was a small queue of people with the owner of the pier and boats leading them on to the boats. Kai raced to the back of the queue as he stood behind a tall Soldier. </p>

    <p>“Alright everyone. Please have your Yearns ready for your stops. The water taxis aren’t free, you know that!” The owner of the pier shouted. A very loud and shrill voice for a very short man. Kai didn’t really take notice of much else as he was too busy looking up at the Soldier in front of him. Taller than Kai by a head or two. His broad shoulders were shrouded in a dark blue, hooded cloak. The hood covered his head. Kai began to look down and looked at the Soldiers back as he could see an enormous sword placed on his back. Kai began to smile until he noticed dark red on the blade, dripping on to the Soldiers pants. Blood was normally a bad sign but Kai was not threatened. The blade had a familiar feeling when he looked at it. It gave him a smile on his young, dirty face. “Excuse me Soldier” Kai politely whispered. The soldier turned his head slightly in acknowledgement with his face still covered as rainwater dropped from his soaking wet hood down onto the wood on the floor as they got closer to the water taxi in the queue. “That blade of yours. Is it a Yurman Special?” Kai asked. The blade was unnaturally large. The hand big enough for six hands and the blade large enough to slice four trees in half. “It isn’t” the Soldier mumbled. “I had one of them but I upgraded to this” the Soldier whispered, still with his back turned to Kai. “Upgraded? Surely nothing is as good as a Yurman special?” Kai asked in puzzlement. The soldier chuckled slightly. “Boy. There is plenty of better weaponry in the rest of Esdon than old Yurman’s Shed” the Soldier bellowed. </p>

    <p>Kai looked at the sword with even more intrigue and fascination. “Apologies to keep asking questions Soldier. But where is this Sword made?” Kai questioned impatiently. The soldier pulled the sword from his back with speed, not even acknowledging the weight and size of it and placed it next to him, blade point into the hole between the wooded floor, still stood with his back to Kai. He then let the blade rock back to Kai as Kai held the blade by the handle and looked at the sword in amazement. Out of its holder, it sparkled from the setting sun, peering through the clouds it was hidden behind all day. It was as clean as a mirror, even with blood on the blade. “It’s from Dulwic, Kai. The mines” the Soldier said casually. Kai still looking in amazement almost missed that the Soldier just spoke his name as he still held the sword by his side and looked up at the Soldiers head. He gazed at the Soldiers hood, waiting for an eye or face to peer back. “H-How do you know my name?” Kai exclaimed nervously. “Who are you?” He added as Kai began to act increasingly worried.</p>
