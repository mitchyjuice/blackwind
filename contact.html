    <img src="castletoesdon.jpg" alt="Castle" class="center">

    <p>As the bright noon laser ray of the sun shone down to the pristine, white courtyard as it stood at its highest point of the day. The high peak of the Spire of the North Tower of the Eindahl Castle walls covered the top of the courtyard in shadow as two huge doors covered in lavish decorations of the highest calibre of woodsman ship and stone masonry faced the courtyard from the north towers walls, the sun shone on the intricacy of the detail on the golden doors. The doors shown of swords and shields, with men of war covering the entirety of the doors. In the middle of the doors stood the main decoration, the crown and a throne. As the doors began to open, the crown and throne split down the middle and revealed a glint of gold and a real crown emerged from the depths of the halls of the Castle, covering golden hair that lay upon broad shoulders. The man that emerged from the doors stepped down the white stone steps onto the carpet which bathed in gold, almost to aacknowledge the relevancy around his head. His bright, blue eyes pierced the day sky as he glanced up to the suns position and then he stared down to the rest of the courtyard with a cold, long stare that darkened his brightened eyes as they lay beneath a strong scowl. The fur of his long brown gown kissed the golden carpet as he took firm steps towards the crowd of people that hung around the centre of the courtyard. He walked with firm confidence and presence as his chin clenched above his broadened chest and straightened posture. Windows and planed glass were open as eyes ccovered and centred onto the centre of the courtyard. All of the sounds that the courtyard mustered were footsteps and the sound of a trembling wind from the east.</p>
    
    <p>The Centre of the courtyard was surrounded by large, white steps that lead on to a huge, gargantuan stone stage with platinum white stone seating surrounding the stage, littered with the gaze of citizens sat in them. People of high calibre etiquette and high in society. Men and Women in long, slick gowns and thick jewellery, dressed their hands and chests like champions of civilisation. Behind the stone stage, stood more steps that lead to a singular, stone seat that arisen high over the stage, almost exaggerating its glory. The seat was drowned in cushions and cloth of the finest golden silk, only meant for one person. On the stage of the courtyard were seven men on their knees, hands bound with rope, dressed in diritied-white, long, cloth robes that doused them from head-to-toe. The men were knelt and hunched over with their heads covered by black cloth, tied with rope round their necks. Next to the seven men perched a large sword in a stone holding. The blade was stained with darkened blood and was connected by a large black, leather helm. The blade was as silver and abnormally large as the nature of the event that was beginning to unfold on the stage splattered with aged blood. Not a sound was made in the courtyard other than the whimpers of certain men under the black cloths on the Stone Stage. The men knelt on stage under the black cloth face coverings, most men breathing with discomfort and few began to whimper louder as the footsteps echoed louder around the courtyard. As the crowned man and his subjects closed in on the stage.</p>
    
    <p>Three men in long, large red gowns that covered their necks down to their ankles waited at the edge of the steps of the stage with their eyes firmly fixed on to the man with the crown. Their heads shaven and identical as though they were kin. They all bore a chain around their necks with a symbol around it. A Strange marking, almost like a sun but with an arrow through it from the right to the left. They all stood perfectly in sync with each other, chin held up to the heavens and hands behind their backs. The red gowns covered from their necks and descended all the way to their ankles, covering their feet and their hands. Only allowing their faces to be present. The man in the crown approached slowly in carriage by a small militia in the same uniform as one another. Round, silver, metal-plated-helmets with just space for their eyes to peer through. Long, red cloaks which covered their backs and ran from their shoulders and connected to the front. On the front lay silver-metal-plated armour that covered their abdomen with spirals and decorations that connected to the ceentre of their chests, which bore a golden crown. Their arms were enveloped in golden chainmail as they walked, moved and stepped in sync, they even seemed to breathe in sync as the acoustics of the courtyard echoed the metal-on-metal collaboration from soldier to soldier.</p>

    <p>All of the soldiers held spears in perfect alignment, even moving them at the exact same moment. Four soldiers on the other hand, aappeared not to be a part of the unit. They walked alongside the man in the crown. Two on the right of him and two on the left. The largest of the men stood next to him, to the right. In the same uniform as the soldiers other than the crown scolded on his armour lay doused in red. He brandished no cloak down his back other than an enormous, well distiguished axe that stuck to his spine. Under his arm, he held his helmet, as his large pale-skinned, battle scarred face, chiselled and athletic with shrewd piercing green-eyes and a shaven head, smiled ahead. The man to the right of the large man, wore a plate of armour just over his chest, no decorations, just the symbol of a broken sword placed on the chest. Under the armour, he wore a black hood that rested on his shoulders. To his back, lay a large bow and no arrows. Long, black-hair lay down his back and rested onto his shoulders as a smirk shrouded his young face as he stepped forward with the rest of the five at the front of the militia. The two men on the left of the crowned man both wore the same armour as the small army, although one carried his helmet and a cold, dead smirk exploded around his face, ominous in reptilic ways. If his smirk didnt sscream that of filth, his face did. His greying short-hair covered his head like bristles and the long, pointed nose under his small, shrew blue-grey-eyes, yelled that of deception. The other man in armour,  walked with a large helmet on his bouldered head that was somehow, even more colossal than the other soldiers. It wwas rectangular-like and in fact, even his armour looked broader than the others. His cloak, black and he carried no weapon as the broadness of his shoulders, clattered the armour which shook from each, ever-colossal step the soldier took.</p>
    
    <p>As the man in the crown approached to the edge of the stages centre. The crowd of people began to rise from their seats and bow. The three men in red gowns bowed from the steps of the stage. “My Lord” they all softly whispered with a smile to the man in the crown. The man in the crown slightly nodded his head in acknowledgement back to the three men and ascended up the stone steps to the stage with his four men. The black-hooded man with the bow and the large, battle-scarred man with the axe, stood at the furthest end of the stage as the man in the crown climbed the steps at the back of the stone stage and took his seat in the comfort of his overly, well-cushioned seat. The reptilic looking man stepped to the front of the steps to the high throne, behind the seven knelt men and the broad soldier with the square helmet stood next to the large sword, placed in the stone holding. He wrapped his large hands around its helm and began to pick it out of the stone. The sheer size of it enough to scare even those in the seats who gasped as he lifted it and placed it next to his body, with it being level with his chest and the helm being in his hand as he stood forward, ready for his masters command.</p>

    <p>“You may all be seated” The reptilian looking man spoke. The civilians in the audience all sat as silence shrouded the courtyard once again. “I am Captain Urden Vole of our Kings Great Forces. I have been chosen on behalf of the great King Ruben himself to speak and honour his presence at this ceremony and delightful day” His well-spoken voice carried around the courtyard as Captain Vole turned around and bowed his head to King Ruben in his throne. King Ruben slightly nodded his head once more in appreciation but with an almost stuck frown to his rugged face. “We are here today in celebration of the end to this forsaken battle. We stand together in victory as we reign supreme, as we always have over the glorious Kingdom of Esdon, under the watch of the greatest King who ever lived. Our great King Ruben. Long may he reign.” Captain Vole exclaimed. “Long may he reign” The audience answered back in unison. Captain Vole carried on speaking as he walked slowly, with his hands behind his back, behind the knelt men. “Now, today is a special day in the history of our great Kingdom. Our enemies have been abolished, Esdon is a whole Kingdom once again and we can relieve our enemies of their heinous crimes in this world as they pass and face judgement in the eyes of Tarmen himself. Today, these seven men will be handed their punishment for the war crimes they have committed to the Kingdom of Esdon, the treason to the King himself and the many, many crimes that are unspeakable to the ears of the King. The punishment for these seven men, is death by the Blade of Judgement”. Captain Vole walked to the far right where the large soldier with the large sword stood. The nearest prisoner knelt as a whimper was heard from his voice. The prisoner shook nervously and began to breathe heavily.</p>
    
    <p>Captain Vole removed the hood and the rope that tightened around his neck, to reveal a shaven head and a man with a slightly beaten face. Tears strolled down his face and the look of despair and defeat wallowed through his body. “This is prisoner number one. Hakim Ronson of the 9th division. Captain of the armies to the Oaken regiments. Leader of the Oaken Kingslayers. Although relatively small in numbers, this man is solely responsible for the death of many good men inside our Kingdom and the death of his whole Army. This man betrayed one of the greatest, special units in our Kingdom, to become head of a group of thieves, rapists and murderers”. The Captain yelled as his words almost seemed to rally a war cry from the audience. “Before we reserve you for judgement to Tarmen. You may be blessed by our relics and you may have you final words spoken in this land”. Captain Vole took but a few steps back and stood perfectly still as the three men in red approached the stage. They walked united in steps and familiarity as they approached the prisoner known as Hakim and they began to put their hands on his head gently, closed their eyes and recited words.</p>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
    <p>    “May your soul be forever blessed,
        Forever guided in the hands of Tarmen,
        Bathed in the oceans of Foromil,
        Cleansed in the name of our saviour,
        Your body be returned to the lands of Esdon,
        To become one with the land.
        For he is holy, 
        He is righteous,
        He is everything and everything is him.
        Our lord Tarmen,
        Take this soul and forgive his sins.
        Oula Tarmensha,
        Bezin”.</p>


        <p>“You will not be given your honours, you may speak your final waking words in this realm”. Captain Vole shouted, as the relics stepped away from the prisoner and down the steps.</p>
        
        <p>“To my fallen men, on my soul, this burden is mine. This fate was not meant for you. To my darling wife and children mercilessly slaughtered at the hands of these evil men. I will see you soon and have my favourite meal awaiting for me in Foromil.” Hakim cried. He stopped and turned his head around as much as his tied-up, knelt body could allow him to and his eyes gazed upon the King in his throne and then his gaze turned to the audience surrounding him. “To the King. Death will come for you soon, Tarmen is in our presence”. Hakim smiled as his cry seemed to have faded, his face accepted his fate as he bowed his head and closed his eyes. Captain Vole nodded his head to the Squared Helmet soldier. The soldier raised the huge sword high and with a flash, it scythed into the ground, as the head of Hakim launched from his body and down the steps. His body flopped to the floor and began to leak crimson down his white gown and onto the clean white stone of the stage as it squirmed for the last moments until it finally halted and became as still as the stone it lay upon.</p>

        <p>“Now onto Prisoner Number Two”. Captain Vole shouted. His face still smirking as if the sight of death was soothing to him now. The Captain strolled to the next prisoner and took the black cloth from the next prisoner along the right of the facing audience. “Darius the Dark. Leader of the Leaf and General of the Armies of Almanor. You were a hard man to catch and now you may die in the City you tried so desperately to abolish. You may also die with pride at your young protégés watchful eye”. Captain Vole looked at the man with the dark hood and the bow on his back and nodded as the Young, dark skinned mans, brown eyes were filled with anger and hate as he looked towards the knelt prisoners face as Darius turned to look at him. Darius was pale and half-beaten as the bruises looked more noticeable on his pasty skin. The smell of blood was rich in the air as the slight breeze, blew the trees across the sound of silence in the courtyard. The two men locked eyes in equal hatred. Darius stared as he spat on the ground looking deep into his eyes. “Let me handle this one” The black hooded man whispered. Captain Vole looked up to the King on the throne as the King Ruben nodded his head gently, almost looking bored by the situation with his hand holding his head up with his elbow rested on the arm of the throne. Captain Vole nodded at the relics as they came on to bless him. “Death to your God and I hope your land rots. Especially, you”. Darius shouted with rage in his voice towards the Man in the Black Hood.  “Your blood is as dirty as the dirty men that linger this place. I knew I should have killed you when I first met you” Darius said despairingly to the black hooded man. Darius spat one more time on the ground as his stare was as strong as the sharpest blade. “You are going to die a painful death, I pro-“. Without a blink of an eye a small metal arrow pierced a column at the edge of the stage and stuck into it with force. Blood drained from the blade, as the dark red dribbled down the vivid-white column. Darius eyes rolled to the back of his head as the temples of his head, fountained deep-red-blood all of a sudden and revealed a hole. His body dropped to the floor with force, as his head spilled more crimson across the floor like paint. The Black-Hooded-Man stood with one arm out in a stance, as though he had just thrown an object. He slowly put his arms back behind his back and slowly smirked again as he raised his chin back up and focused his eyes on the sky. King Ruben looked down his nose at the Black-Hooded-Man almost calculating him and his movements. Weighing him up. The blood that fountained from the two executed prisoners rang around the courtyard as it lay silent. The audience still gazed on as most members began to smile at the merciless of the executioner and the power of the lustful King. </p>
        
        <p>“JUST PLEASE LET ME GO, PLEASE!” a shout was heard from under a black cloth next to the body of Darius the Dark. “You are under the command of King Ruben now, not yourself. Show your respect” Captain Vole stated firmly as he launched a right-footed boot at the side of the head of the prisoner. The prisoner fell onto the body of Darius the Dark and was slowly picked up by the rope round his neck by Captain Vole. As he rose back to his knees, Vole took the black cloth off his head. “Prisoner number 3. Robert of Almanor or Robert the Great as the Almanorians loved to call you. Finding you hiding under that ale-house in Gallsworth, hiding and then screaming for your mother when you were caught would be a lovely story wouldnt it.” Captain Vole sternly said. “I DIDNT DO ANYTHING. PLEASE MY LORD, I DID NOT DO ANY OF THESE THINGS” Robert shouted as tears fountained down his cheeks and despair shrouded his face. “PLEASE SOMEBODY, I DIDNT TELL MY MEN TO DO THESE THINGS, IT WAS A TRICK” He screamed. Captain Vole closed his eyes, shook his head and tutted. “Ah, Our mistake” He whispered. “YOURE GOING TO LET ME GO?” Robert shouted desperately, as a desperate smile began to cover his face. “Let you go? Never. The mistake I mentioned was that you would take your punishment like the man you were mythed to be. Maybe we should put you down like a dog after we have worked you like one” Vole growled. “YES. PLEASE, I WILL DO ANYTHING. I WILL WORK AND PROVE I AM OF GREAT SERVICE TO YOU KING RUBEN” Robert began to smile as tears of desperation dropped from his chin as he began to shout louder and sound even more desperate. “This man deserves no prayer to Tarmen” King Ruben suddenly spoke as the audience suddenly began to turn their attention to the King. Roberts face dropped from desperation to despair. “End this worms life now Captain” the King stated with anger. “As you wish my King” Vole whispered, nodding his head and turning to the executioner and nodding his head once more. The executioner slowly walked along dragging the blade across the stone floor as the metal screeched on the stone. Vole moved back slowly. “NO PLEASE, DONT DO THIS, I HAVE MORE INFORMATION, I KNOW ABOU-“ the blade cut the middle of Roberts head, as it sliced down his body like a knife through cake and cut the man in half. The slow despair in his eyes dissipated as blood began to cover over the blue iris in Roberts eyes. Both sides of his body separated onto the floor and his innards leaked like a waterfall on to the white, stone floor as the executioner picked his sword back up to the side of his body without remorse or any reaction to the horror of the mangled body of Robert of Almanor. “The most disrespectful execution is what you deserve. Tarmen will send you to the depths of eternal torture” Vole exclaimed as he spat on Roberts tortured body and looked on it in disgust.</p>
        
        <p>“We are running out of time Captain. I have places to be” King Ruben sternly said. Frowning down at Captain Vole. Worry quickly covered Voles face. “Y-yes my Lord” Vole stuttered.</p>
        
        <p>Captain Vole whispered into the Executioners ear, “We will save the best for last but do the other three quickly”. The Executioner nodded in agreement as he quickly tightened his grip on the handle of the large blade and raised it above his large, helmet-laden head as blood began to run down the tip of the blade onto his black, blood-soaked gloves. Captain Vole stepped in front of the remaining prisoners and over the desecrated bodies that lay on the floor, covered in crimson, towards the front of the stone stage. “We are running short on time, fellow Esdonians. We must execute the other three at once and save the best for last” He exclaimed as his usual slow, well-spoken voice sounded more rushed. He removed each black cloth from three heads of the prisoners, missing the prisoner that knelt on the far left, next to the large, battle-scarred man.</p>
        
        <p>Vole stood behind the Prisoner on the far-right. An old man, his face as aged as the cloth on his back. His head lay with patches of white, shaven-hair or bare skin. “Prisoner number four, Yangel Terring or Yangel the Wise from Mirgons Way. You have been tried for the crimes of committing treason against King Ruben and the lands of Esdon, you will die under the great sword of Eindahl”. Vole moved on to the next prisoner who knelt in the middle of the three now revealed prisoners. His face was beaten to a traumatic sight as his eyes swelled with bruises as his tears of fear ran a stream of blood. He wobbled and shook, hardly able to kneel or raise his head. “Prisoner number five, Greymoor Farhide from Neymoor in Altonshire. You have been tried for the crimes of treason to King Ruben and the lands of Esdon, you will die under the great sword of Eindahl”. Vole rushed behind the next Prisoner. A man who only held a black eye on his moon-kissed white skin as his naturally skin-shaved head shined in the afternoon sun. He looked down at the stone floor in misery. “Prisoner number six, Luco Parting from Eastlings, Stromfeld. You have been tried for the crimes of treason, murder, war crimes and theft of artefacts that are only for the hands of royalty from the royal tombs. You will die under the great sword of Eindahl and under Tarmens name. Your crimes of theft will result to your hands being removed and placed on your head in your bodys eternal rest. May Tarmen judge you swiftly.” Vole nodded to the three relics as he moved to the back of the stage once more. The three relics slowly walked up to the stage the courtyard lay still silent. They each stood behind each prisoner and placed a hand on their heads synchronised. They said the Tarmen prayer of death over their heads softly as they closed their eyes.</p>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <p>“May your soul be forever blessed,
        Forever guided in the hands of Tarmen,
        Bathed in the oceans of Foromil,
        Cleansed in the name of our saviour,
        Your body be returned to the lands of Esdon,
        To become one with the land.
        For he is holy, 
        He is righteous,
        He is everything and everything is him.
        Our lord Tarmen,
        Take this soul and forgive his sins.
        Oula Tarmensha,
        Bezin”.</p>



        <p>The relics finished their prayer as all three of the men slumped their heads down. Silence still covered the air and the smell of the fresh blood from the three limp bodies that lay executed, filled the noses of the remaining living. The Executioner weighed up the slice he was going to take by measuring the distance, as the sword was big enough to take all three heads. “You may mow speak your final words in this land” Vole muttered.</p>
        <p>“May Mian have mercy on your souls. Beywer, protect my family” Yangel quietly spoken to his bowed head. The other two remained silent as they both looked at Yangel. Almost, a look of relief beheld their faces as they raised their chins and welcomed whatever fate became of them. Yangel raised his chin with mercy on his old face. The old man looked worried and remorseful as his final seconds closed in, he could not muster any more words from his lips. Before the old man could close his eyes, the swipe of the sword launched his head down the steps, along with the other two heads. The heads rolled down the stairs as the blade touched the stone of the floor again by the Executioners side. Blood shot from the gaping holes in the necks of the executed prisoners as their bodies began to flutter and twitch for their final moments. The sounds of the dripping of blood echoed through the silent courtyard after the thud of their bodies and heads crashed to the stone floor as the audience sat still and silent. Captain Vole nodded towards the large battle-scarred man at the edge of the stage, stood next to the black-hooded man, still stood with his chin up and smirking. The battle-scarred man, stood behind the remaining prisoner and threw off his black cloth from the prisoners head, still holding his helmet under his other arm.</p>
        <p>The remaining prisoners face appeared in the bright noon sun to the usual shaven-head of a prisoner, ready to be executed. His eyes dark. A strong brisk nose and jaw, punched through his beaten face as cuts and bruises completed his appearance. His face shown courage as he raised his chin to the audience and kept a stern, scowling face. “Prisoner number seven. Tarin Mellok, Ghost of the North.” The audience gasped as they began to confer between themselves. “I thought he was dead” “I thought he didn’t exist” “How have they caught The Ghost of the North?” “So it is true”.</p>
        <p>Whispers from the audience floated around the courtyard on the soft breeze of the summer air. The King began to grin as his usual bored face now bled excitement as he began to sit forward in his throne. Captain Vole began to lick his lips like an animal, ready to devour its prey as the rest of the men in the Kings Company began to grin to themselves. Vole stood over the executed prisoners as he carried the puddles of blood along his soles around the stone stage and wiped it on the cloth that lay on the backs of one of the prisoners. “Tarin Mellok. Ghost of the North. From Faust Town, Faust. You have been tried with Murder, War Crimes, Witchcraft and the highest of all treasons to King Ruben and the Kingdom of Esdon. You will be handed the Execution from your captor, General Minski” Captain Vole shouted sounding almost amused. He nodded towards the battle-scarred man, who was stood behind the Ghost of the North. General Minski slowly pulled the axe from his back and held it tight. It was a tall, silver axe with heavy, sharp iron edges at the edges of its blade. An arrow pointed through the top and the markings that ran round the shaft to the handle, were written in an old Esdonian tongue. General Minski looked toward the Relics at the bottom of the stage. “Give this man a Prayer” he shouted. As the relics approached the steps and slowly walked up to give the Esdonian Prayer of Death, Tarin raised his beaten head and shouted “No”. Everyone paused in the courtyard and even King Ruben seemed to squirm in his seat. “I do not require a prayer towards your God. I pray to my own” Tarin exclaimed. “I respect that” Minski replied softly, almost bowing his head to Tarin. “One warrior to another, you have my greatest respect. May your God judge you worthy” General Minski whispered to Tarin. The Ghost of the North forced a slight smile on the corner of his blood-filled mouth. “Thank you General” Tarin replied. King Ruben moved forward in his seat and seemed to look furious at the exchange between the two. “Will you just give him his final words and be done with it” King Ruben shouted maliciously. Tarin turned round slowly and with the corners of his dark eyes, looked into Rubens very soul. “Remember this day Ruben. Remember these words. I have seen all you fear. I have seen your very blood spill. I know your future. Your end will come and it will come at the hands of one of us” Tarin began to smile and turned back around to face the audience as he lifted his chin ready to meet his end with dignity. “END HIM NOW!” King Ruben roared at the General. The King was enraged. Ruben jumped out of his seat as the veins in his head began to throb out of his skull. General Minski raised the axe back and took the full swing. Tarins head rolled down the steps of the stage as the blood from the wound sprayed on General Minski’s face and body armour. The proud smile stayed on Tarin’s face right to the end as the audience began to applaud the General for executing their biggest enemy. The general took his axe onto his back into its holder once more as a look of remorse filled his face. He looked at the head rolling around the floor near the relics feet at the bottom of the steps. Minski began to stare into the dead eyes of Tarins head at the bottom of the steps and began to feel a regret. He looked away and pulled a cloth from a leather pocket that lay at his side and wiped his face from the blood and placed it back into the leather pocket.</p>
        <p>The King began to clap along with the audience as everyone stood up from their seats. The Kings frown had turned into a malicious smile as he raised from his seat so fast, he almost looked to be celebrating, exaggerating his applause. Men dressed in rags and children with dirt on their faces and nothing but skin and bare-bone for bodies came rushing in from other doors around the courtyard and began to immediately clean the blood and throw the body parts and bodies into wheelbarrows ready to be buried or burnt. The King rose to his feet, still clapping under the afternoon sun. “My fellow Esdonians. Let us rejoice in this day and bask in the glory of Esdon” Captain Vole shouted. “For today, the War of the Twelve is over”. The audience rushed into an even larger rupture of applause with some even whistling in victory. Even the soldiers that stood around the stage joined. The King began to smirk as the surrounding death filled his lungs. He took a deep breath of the air and welcomed it. General Minski began to clap and smile politely. The man in the Black Hood applauded along as he watched intently on the body of Darius the Dark be taken away by slave boys in their rags and wheelbarrows. His face still as cold and calculated as it had been when he drove an arrow through his old masters head.</p>
        <p>“Now let us feast!” the King shouted as his soldiers stopped the applause and synchronised their feet to turn around as the King walked from the Stone Throne, down the stage and in front of the soldiers, along with the four men that accompanied him into the courtyard. The King met at the front with The General and leant over slowly. “We must meet in the War Room later General, I have a task for you all. Assemble your leaders and your special forces” the King whispered into the Generals ear. “Yes, my Lord” the general nodded and replied. General Minski walked on ahead as the remaining three at the front of the militia began to follow. The King walked slowly back to the door he approached from as he reached the two steps before the door at the end of the courtyard and climbed to the second step. He turned around menacingly and watched the body and head of Tarin be put into a wheelbarrow and did not take his eyes off it until it left sight being carried by the small slave boys and men, staring at it and calculating his next movements.</p>
        <p>The King approached his quarters and began to walk up the levelled spiral steps that led up the very peak of the north tower inside the spire that looked over all of Eindahl. When he approached the top of the spire, he barged open a large wooden door that squeaked open slowly. The room was filled to the brim of exotic riches. From his monumental bed that spanned the room. His slick fur sheets and covers from the art that hung from the walls. Rare heads of hunted beasts and extinct animals hung from his walls as hunting trophies and rare items from around Esdon that was just fodder to him. Truly living like a King. A large item hung from his paned window that would open along with his window. Large and obelisk looking with a wooden finish and gold around each end. The large end of the item hung out of the window and the small end hung in the room. Glass was at each end of it. It was a large looking glass that could see for miles.</p>
        <p>King Ruben approached the looking-glass and began to look through it. Looking at the whole of the Esdon Capital… Eindahl. His focus swiftly went to a Harbour. Ships lined the docks and piers and workers, fisherman and traders ran amok around the area. Ruben focused on a certain sailing ship which waited in the centre of the harbour. Large like most ships, with a wide wooden body that had metal coverings over where the windows should usually be. Ruben twisted a small lever on the right of the looking instrument as another pane of glass moved in front of it to magnify the looking glass closer to the harbour. He could now see the streets that lined the harbour clearly as he twisted the lever one more time to clearly see the faces of the citizens and workers on the harbour and on the ship. No passers-by or civilians seemed to be near the ship only guards and men in grey rags, which were all chained together being led by the guards and assaulted by each guard they passed as they walked in line and on to the ship. Each one, one-by-one, entering the ship and receiving a blow to the head by a large bearded man who led the guards. “Where are you” Ruben whispered to himself. Ruben seemed to move the looking glass through every single prisoner, itching for a certain someone to come into his view. The sea crashed against the boat, rocking it and nearly knocking prisoners off the boat as they walked up the wooden pier that led into its main deck. The sun still beamed in the air as the temperatures still soared around Eindahl as Ruben took off his fur robe and threw it on his marbled floor. His slight, muscular frame accented the tight white shirt that laced at his sides as he uncovered his belt which revealed four golden knives that lay on it. Knives with the heads of golden bears, carved into the end of the brims.</p>
        <p>He threw the long, fur robe and belt on the floor without a care in the world and returned to looking through the glass. He began to look through the glass much more rigorously, almost swinging it off its hinges. “THERE!” he shouted to himself as he gave the lever a slight twist, as a small piece of glass passed in front of the looking glass to zoom in slightly more. Ruben began to grin to himself as a large man, beaten with bruises all over his face began to enter the wooden pier onto the boat. Worry crowned his chiselled face as his blue eyes darkened from the bruising around them. Short blonde hair that greased back and forth and covered his face with a short blonde beard, covered what remained of his face as he parried along onto the wood. He approached the top of the ship where the bearded guard stood and the guard seemed to enjoy beating him over the head with a metal rod he held. The prisoner fell onto his knees as two guards dragged him onto the ship by his long arms and out of sight. Ruben moved away from the looking glass and began to smirk maliciously as he closed his window and walked over to his bed and sat on the edge as began to pull his black silk trousers down. Ruben snapped his fingers as the waistline of his trousers hit the floor. Four women entered the room dressed in low cut dresses and high skirts. The last of the women closed the heavy wooden door to Rubens chambers as a wry smile varnished his face.</p>
        <p>Days had passed since the executions and clouds preyed over the mountains to the East of Esdon. Two men rode slowly on horseback. One man wore a large black coat that held a black hood that draped his face in shadow. On his back, he carried a large blade and in his large brown horses saddle lay two more blades. The other horse rider rode a large grey horse and his long brown hair draped his shoulders as a look of tiredness reflected from the bags under his blue eyes. A large brown beard kissed his chest, as the long grey jacket he wore leant off the horse to the top of his black boots. In his saddle lay a large sword that fit perfectly into a sword holder that bore the markings of old-riddled tongue that was not of Old Esdonian. It was ever more ancient. The two men rode side-by-side at the same pace as they spoke and laughed together. The man in the hood took his hood down and revealed a wise face with slightly-greying, brown hair with a slightly-greying, brown beard that stuck under his battle hardened nose and skin. His blue eyes told a tale of hardened battles and former glories. Their horses rode up a hillside as they approached the top.</p>
        <p>“Who even takes this old road towards the Mines anymore” The man in the black coat exclaimed. “You have me there, brother. But we seemed to have made great tracks on this shortcut” The man in grey replied. They both gave a slight smile as they approached a peak that lead to a clearing of the mountain. “We should be able to see the Dulwic Temple from this peak and even further to Dirimir” The man in grey exclaimed. “I hope so” the other man replied “The clouds seem to reach lower than they used to” He added. They continued their walk up the mountain side as the peak edged closer to the front of their horses. “Well at least war isn’t an option for a long time. Peace would be good for Esdon” the man in black said. “Peace is not an option under the current ruler, you know that” The man in grey said. “But surely we must accept that peace will be around for a good while longer now that War is over?” the man in black questioned the man in grey. The man in grey shook his head in disagreement as they took the first step onto the peak “Look deeper, you can see it for yourself” he replied. They both stepped off their horses as the man in black looked towards the North East. The man in black carried on “I do see it, but I see hope in the eyes of a Bear” and before he could finish his sentence, the man in black could see a shine of glass that peered over the clouds and mountains in the distance as it glared of the sun.</p>
        <p>“Over there Omi. Look, I see the first tower of the temple” the man in black exclaimed. Omi continued to look south-east as he stepped but a few steps forward. “Omi, look!” he exclaimed again. Omi continued to stare South-East. Fear and dread plagued his face as his eyes strained wide open and began to shake with pale colours beginning to cover his already pasty skin. “I’m afraid the peace you wished upon Yumi, is the furthest away it could possibly be” Omi softly said with a slight shake in his voice. “What do you speak of here my brother?” Yumi exclaimed. “It has returned.” Omi grunted as a lump in his throat passed. They both looked into the distance towards the South-East as puzzlement covered Yumi’s face while fear stuck to the face of the aging Omi. As Yumi looked on and looked towards Omi’s face, the reality of what Omi meant, struck his aging face. The Brothers looked on towards Dirimir, as they stood perfectly still and took in deep breaths simultaneously.</p>
